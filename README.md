# Text Summarization Tool

A Python-based text summarization tool using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to condense lengthy documents into concise, relevant summaries. This project uses the NLTK library for text preprocessing and employs an extractive summarization approach based on word frequency analysis.

## Objective
To improve information accessibility by generating quick, effective summaries of news articles, reports, and other documents.

## Key Features
- **Extractive Summarization**: Selects sentences based on their word frequency and relevance.
- **Text Preprocessing**: Includes tokenization, stopword removal, and word frequency analysis using NLTK.
- **Sentence Scoring**: Ranks sentences by their word importance to identify key content.

## Technologies
- Python
- [NLTK](https://www.nltk.org/) (Natural Language Toolkit)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- NLTK library

To install the required libraries, run:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Installation
1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Text-Summarization-Tool.git
    ```
2. Change into the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd Text-Summarization-Tool
    ```

### Usage

1. **Download NLTK Data**: Run the following in Python to download necessary datasets.
    ```python
    import nltk
    nltk.download('punkt')
    nltk.download('stopwords')
    ```

2. **Run the Summarizer**:
    - You can test the summarizer on a sample text:
    ```bash
    python summarizer.py --input data/sample.txt --output summary.txt
    ```

## Code Overview

- **summarizer.py**: Implements the main text summarization algorithm.
- **preprocess.py**: Contains text preprocessing functions, including tokenization, stopword removal, and frequency analysis.

## Example Output

Given an input text, the summarizer generates a concise summary based on word importance. For example:

**Input Text:**
```
[Sample text goes here...]
```

**Output Summary:**
```
[Generated summary goes here...]
```

## Outcome
The summarizer has been tested on news articles and reports, effectively condensing content and demonstrating NLP's role in information retrieval.
