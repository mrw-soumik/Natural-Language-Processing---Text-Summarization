Text summarization is the task of shortening a text document to create a summary that includes the most important information.
It is a common problem in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and can be achieved using extractive or abstractive methods.
Extractive summarization selects sentences directly from the document, while abstractive summarization generates new sentences.
Summarization is especially valuable when dealing with large amounts of text data, making it easier for users to quickly obtain the key points.
For instance, in the context of news articles, summarization can allow readers to stay updated without reading lengthy reports.
The techniques in NLP have grown with advancements in machine learning, enabling better content condensation.
